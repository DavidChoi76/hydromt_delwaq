Selection of substance(s) and processes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When setting-up D-Emission, we decided to model the substance Total Nitrogen (TN) emitted by households. As TN is a  quite complex substance with many processes 
and interactions with different forms of Nitrogen molecule, in the following tutorials, as a simplified example, we will model **Total Nitrogen (TN)** as a 
simple constant tracer cTR.
