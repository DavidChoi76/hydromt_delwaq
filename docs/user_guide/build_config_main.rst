Working with the DELWAQ plugin in HydroMT
=========================================

This HydroMT plugin provides an implementation for DELWAQ in order to build, update or clip from 
command line. Specific details on the HydroMT CLI methods can be found in the
`core documentation <https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_plugin/latest/user_guide/cli.html>`_ 

The DELWAQ model class in HydroMT is able to prepare and interact both with EM or WQ types of DELWAQ models. The links below highlight the different aspects of preparing, building, and updating the DELWAQ model
