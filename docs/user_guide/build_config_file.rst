Configuration file
------------------
Settings to build or update a Delwaq model are managed in a configuration file. In this file, 
every option from each :ref:`model component <model_components>` can be changed by the user 
in its corresponding section.

In addition to the model components, the ini also contains a [global] section 
in order to specify if the model to build/update is either an EM or a WQ model ('mtype' option).

.. code-block:: console

    [global]
    mtype = WQ                     # type of Delwaq model ['EM', 'WQ']

Most of the options are the same for preparing either a EM or WQ type of model. The main difference is with the 
hydrological information needed by each model type. For an **EM** type of model, these are:

- **precip**: precipitation
- **infilt**: the amount of the precipitation that infiltrates into the soil from unpaved areas
- **runPav**: the amount of the precipation that goes directly to surface runoff from paved areas
- **runUnp**: the amount of the precipation that goes directly to surface runoff from unpaved areas

For a **WQ** type of model, these are:

- **run**: surface runoff
- **vol**: surface water volumes
- **inwater** - **inwaterInternal**: total water entering the surface waters (e.g. precipitation, exfiltration from the soil, 
  evaporationâ€¦) in order to close the surface water mass balance.

Below is an example of ini file that can be used to build a complete **EM model**
:download:`.ini file <../examples/examples/delwaq_build_EM.ini>`. Each section corresponds 
to a model component with the same name.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/examples/delwaq_build_EM.ini
   :language: Ini

Below is an example of ini file that can be used to build a complete **WQ model**
:download:`.ini file <../examples/examples/delwaq_build_WQ.ini>`. Each section corresponds 
to a model component with the same name.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/examples/delwaq_build_WQ.ini
